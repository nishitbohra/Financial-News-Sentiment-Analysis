#  Financial News Sentiment Analysis  

## Overview  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze sentiment in financial news articles. By leveraging multiple Kaggle datasets, we classify financial news as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.  

## Features  
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Multiple financial news datasets from Kaggle  
2. **Text Preprocessing** â€“ Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal  
3. **Word Vectorization** â€“ TF-IDF, Word2Vec for meaningful representation  
4. **Sentiment Classification** â€“ ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)  
5. **Visualization** â€“ Word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs
